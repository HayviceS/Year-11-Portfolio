    <h4>Low Poly Character</h4>
    <h4>Overveiw</h4>

    <div class="y11p">
        <p>I have made a low poly character for a game. This character was made this character by modling it and rigging it allowing me to to animate it's movements. My character
             will have to be able to run, jump, punch, shoot, stand, etc. It is designed to survive in a bleak sci-fi world, the charcter has colourful clothes to make a 
             contrast aganist the background leading it to be easier to see. 
        </p>

    <h4>End users</h4>
        <p>The end users for my low poly character are teen girls around the ages of 13 to 17, who live in westernised countries. They will have to have an interest in survial/action
         games. It might also help if they like dystopian movies like divergent and maze runner. They will want a clean animation and easy to spot character. They may be 
         more attracted to a serious yet relatable character design.
