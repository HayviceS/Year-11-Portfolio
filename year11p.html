    <h4>Low Poly Character</h4>
    <h4>Overveiw</h4>

    <div class="y11p">
        <p>For this project I have been tasked to design, model, and animate a Low-Poly Character. This character was made by modling it and rigging it allowing me to to animate 
            it's movements. My character will have to be able to run, jump, stand, grab, etc. I designed my character with the game type in mind. The game is an adventure where 
            my character has to rome a world where people see him as secondary because he is a robot that has become out of date and less technologicly advanced as others around him. 
            The world around him with be mostly bright colours like white and blue, and he will be a dark gray making him stand out on the screen. The world around my charater 
            will also be made of sharp shapes and edages making his soft curves unique. In the game our main character naviagtes the world around him and has to complete quests 
            to make a living and find purpose in a world where he is now deemed useless. 
        </p>

    <h4>End users</h4>
        <p>For the end users I suspect they will be around the ages of 10-18 and any gender. The game will be best for people who enjoy playing and or rooting for the underdog and 
            who like games with futuristic themes. It is not a violent game so I wouldn't recommend it to people who typicly play action based games. The end users will want a 
            simple yet effective charater design that is easy to see on the screen. They will need easy to use machanics in the game and it needs to be clear where they need to go
            when completeing tasks. These things will make the game fun to play as well as make it playable. 
        </p>

    <h4>Implications</h4>
    <h5>Aesthtics</h5>
    <p>I choose to make my character stand out through the less technolgicly advanced design, unsual shapes, and soft design, in a world built thousands of years in the future and 
        with hard sharp shapes. The simplicty of my character is also what makes him stand out due to the complex world. The world around my character will be made up of 
        light colours like whites and blues, where as my character will be coloured a dark grey making my character stand out as he will for the most part be the darkest thing on 
        the screen. This will make the character stand out in not just shape but color as well. 
    </p>
    <h5>Functionality</h5>
    <p>For functionality I will make sure everything on the body is attched to the torso. This is important because when moving the character the users will want it to stay together
        and not fall apart. Not only this but I will make sure the animation is clean and the character is easily seen to make the game as functional as possiable. 
    </p>
    <h5> Usability</h5>
    <p>I will insure the game has clear instructions on have to move the character and show how it can interact with the game. I will also make sure both these things are possible
        to make sure the game it able to be played.  
    </p>
    <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
    <p>I have taken inspriation from Tagbot a character in Subway Serfers by SYBO Games. To change the design I made the character more blocky while keeping a similer shape. I 
        also took way the hat and changed the coloring of the orginal design, making it my own.
