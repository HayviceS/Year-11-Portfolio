    <h4>Low Poly Character</h4>
    <h4>Overveiw</h4>

    <div class="y11p">
        <p>I have made a low poly character for a game. This character was made this character by modling it and rigging it allowing me to to animate it's movements. My character
             will have to be able to run, jump, stand, etc. I designed my character with the game type in mind. The game is an adventure where my character has to rome a world 
             where people see him as secondary because he is a robot that has become out of date and less technologicly advanced as others around him.
        </p>

    <h4>End users</h4>
        <p>For the end users I suspect they will be around the ages of 10-18 and any gender. The game will be best for people who enjoy playing and rooting for the underdog and who
            like games with futuristic themes. It is not a violent game so I wouldn't recommend it to people who typicly play action based games. 
        </p>

    <h4>Implications</h4>
    <h5>Aesthtics</h5>
    <p>I choose to make my character stand out through the less technolgicly advanced design, unsual shapes, and soft design, in a world built thousands of years in the future and 
        with hard sharp shapes. This will make the character stand out in not just shape but color as well. 
    </p>
    <h5>Functionality</h5>
    <p>For functionality I will make sure everything on the body is attched to the torso. Not only this but I will make sure the animation is clean and the character is easily seen 
        to make the game as functional as possiable. 
    </p>
    <h5> Usability</h5>
    <p>I will insure the game has clear instructions on have to move the character and show how it can interact with the game. I will also make sure both these things are possible
        to make sure the game it able to be played.  
    </p>
    <h5>Intellectual Property</h5>
    <p>I have taken inspriation from Tagbot a character in Subway Serfers by SYBO Games. To change the design I made the character more blocky while keeping a similer shape. I 
        also took way the hat and changed the coloring of the orginal design, making it my own.
