        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>As of right now I am a year 11 student working toward NCEA level 2. I live in Auckland, New Zealand and have my entire life. I am part of a family of 6, it containing, my Mum,
            Dad, two elder sisters and twin sister. I enjoy spending time with others, but I need to take myself away and decompress. I am also very active,enjoying working out, 
            going on walks or runs, as well as tramping and swimming. Having time to do these things is very important to me and I appresiate when I get to take
            part in these activies. </p>
            <br>
        <h1>How I work</h1>
        <p>People tend to say I am a hard working indeviual and I have to agree. I love to solve problem even if at times they can annoy me. While I am good at working with others
            I like to mostly work on my own. This is because I find I get the most work done when I have music playing in the background and my mind is only focused on the task infront
            of me. </p>
            <br>
        <h1>My personailty</h1>
        <p>I am a livley and bubbly person who values, honestly, creativity and independance. Sometimes I can be shy infront of a big group of people but if I know what I am talking 
            about I deliever what I am saying with confidince. I normally get along with everyone I meet but if I do find it hard to work with someone I put my reivations aside and 
            try my best to make it work. </p>
